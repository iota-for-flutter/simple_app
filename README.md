# Simple App - Flutter template

This repository contains a pure Flutter project. It is part of the [_IOTA for Flutter_](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial) Tutorial and belongs to the chapter [_Building a Simple App_](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial/building-a-simple-app/whats-the-result.html).

It serves as the Flutter template from which a complete Flutter-Rust app is built in the tutorial. In terms of functionality, the app allows users to enter a message and a tag, which are then sent to the Shimmer Networks' Tangle after validation.
