# Simple App - Flutter template

This repository contains a pure Flutter project. It is part of the [_IOTA for Flutter_ tutorial](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial) and belongs to the chapter "Building a Simple App". It serves as the Flutter template from which a complete Flutter-Rust app is built in the tutorial. In terms of functionality, the app allows users to enter a message and a tag, which are then sent to the Shimmer Networks' Tangle after validation.
